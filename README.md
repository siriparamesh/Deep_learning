<h1> # Deep_learning </h1>
As a part of MIT's introductory program on deep learning, basic projects on DL were built from the software lab sessions  during the course of the program.  
<h2> Intro to TensorFlow and Music Generation with RNNs </h2>
<h3> learnt the basics of computations in TensorFlow, the Keras API, and TensorFlow's execution style<br>
Building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. Using a "character RNN" to predict the next character of sheet music in ABC notation. Finally, we will sample from this model to generate a new music file that has never been heard before!</h3>
